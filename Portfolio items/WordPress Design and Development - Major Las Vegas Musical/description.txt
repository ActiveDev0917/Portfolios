Project description
First the producers of the Las Vegas musical A Mob Story and I worked together to create a slide-based user experience favored by competitors. Then I redesigned and redeveloped the whole thing in the style of Cirque using high quality video and photo assets created for the purpose. Project features included:

✅ UX optimized to drive ticket sales
✅ Integrated photography grids and carousels for maximum impact
✅ Modal video pop to showcase the quality teaser
✅ Mobile-first design loses no rich media in translation

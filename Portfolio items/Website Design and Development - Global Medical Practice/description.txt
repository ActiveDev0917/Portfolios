Project description
❍ Challenge
A world-renowned gynecological oncologist had an outdated site that did not reflect the importance of his practice. His staff needed a resource that helped facilitate daily routines while offering hope and information to patients.

❑ Solution
The project demanded a parallel evolution of design and content, with a smart architecture that could evolve while supporting an extraordinary number of menus and page structures. Clarity of design and warmth of welcome drove the twin efforts to make a space where patients feel safe and understood.

✰ Outcome
Patients seeking specialized care receive a comprehensive overview of the practice, their condition, and the treatment options available to them. Office staff maintain the website and use it daily to facilitate patient interaction.

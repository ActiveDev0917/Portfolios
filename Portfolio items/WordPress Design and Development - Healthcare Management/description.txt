Project description
Connect The Docs is the premier medical management firm in North County San Diego. They had an outdated website that performed poorly on mobile and failed to convey the breadth of their services. I designed and developed an exciting, memorable, and user-friendly online showcase for them that reflects their trusted brand. Project features included:

✅ Top-to-bottom redesign and relaunch
✅ Maximum use of a fully licensed suite of powerful industry-specific images
✅ Design focus on a clear user path through complex service offerings
✅ Hero videos that play on the brand name while projecting gravitas

"We went from a boring, basic, and outdated website to a vibrant, inviting and modern site. All his past work fit exactly what we needed, he is definitely above his competition. Not to mention he has a terrific personality and very easy to work with." ~ Tom and Kathy Dawson, Owners, Connect The Docs Medical Management

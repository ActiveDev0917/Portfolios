Project description
Women's Integrative Health is a clinic in San Diego County founded by and specializing in the health of women. The founders had a starter website that did not project the woman-friendly, expert care image they desired. I created a site for them that made full use of the professional photography they commissioned for the purpose. Project features included:

✅ Clean and minimalist UX emphasizing approachable expertise
✅ Content organized for straightforward patient communication
✅ Designed to embody the qualities of women-friendly healthcare

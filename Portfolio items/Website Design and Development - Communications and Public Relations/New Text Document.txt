Project description
❍ Challenge
An existing client was founding a new communications firm. She needed a website that conveyed many of the same themes and services we addressed previously but with a different look and feel to distinguish the brands visually.

❑ Solution
Where our first website made use of black-and-white, the new firm's website leverages a vivid color scheme and a custom set of scroll-based animations that play with the circle accent in their logo.

✰ Outcome
The firm launched with an eye-catching services showcase whose video backgrounds and dynamic animations translate equally well to mobile screens. Clients are treated to a user experience at once highly distinctive and totally differentiated from the first site.

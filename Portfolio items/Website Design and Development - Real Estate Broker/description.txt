Project description
❍ Challenge
A successful broker relied heavily on an outdated website to show listings and capture leads. He wanted to reinvent, following the inspiration of a nationally marketed broker but within strict branding limitations set by the brokerage.

❑ Solution
Designing a power-packed long-form home page solved early questions about reconciling the personal and brokerage brands. A unique hybrid style balanced the client's personal brand desires while adhering to brokerage rules.

✰ Outcome
A state-of-the-art WordPress solution that combines a custom-optimized commercial theme with a fully custom plugin handling the API work allows the client to maintain the site in-house with regular design and content updates.

Project description
❍ Challenge
A leading southern California neurological center had an outdated and inaccessible website. They needed a redesign and redevelopment from the ground up with a turnkey solution for future in-house management.

❑ Solution
A dynamic user experience guides visitors through a color scheme that conveys the cutting-edge nature of the center's various treatments. A refined architecture makes it easy for patients to book appointments, review doctors, and connect with the center directly in a seamless warm handoff.

✰ Outcome
All of the client's pain points from the previous incarnation were resolved, most notably with a clear presentation of the various center locations. A state-of-the-art WordPress infrastructure is managed and updated in-house.

Project description
The futurist author and speaker Daniel Levine asked me to help him create a memorable online destination for his audience. His existing site did not convey the modern, captivating experience he imagined and he trusted me to intuit his vision. In addition to a dynamic redesign + redevelopment of his official site, I built a library of password-protected landing pages he could customize himself for different audiences. 

Project features included:

✅ Unique hero videos across main pages
✅ Dynamic scroll effects
✅ Animating testimonials
✅ Comprehensive PDF press library
✅ Password-protected landing pages for segmented audiences
✅ Sticky elements

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ "I needed a modern website design that reflects my work as a futurist while still being easy to use. Stephen created a visual experience for my audience that met my high demands while making the backend easy to manage and extend on my own. When we launched I felt I'd traded up to the Maserati of websites." ~ Daniel Levine

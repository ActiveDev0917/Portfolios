Project description
❍ Challenge
A major footwear company partnered with a national sport coaching association to offer an independent membership experience. They had little in the way of content and the key differentiators of the brand had not been identified.

❑ Solution
A comprehensive content solution derived from the questionnaire method lays out the association's mission and clearly defines what set it apart from alternatives. A backend makes updates and event publishing a snap.

✰ Outcome
The association now boasts of a better-designed website than any of its competitors, and its team manages a technology solution on the backend that allows both event ticket selling and annual recurring (subscription) membership payments.

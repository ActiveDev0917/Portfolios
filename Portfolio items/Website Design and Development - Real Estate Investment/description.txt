Project description
❍ Challenge
A national real estate investment and development firm headquartered in Colorado required a complete redesign of their website to better reflect their brand, their achievements, and their next opportunities.

❑ Solution
Collaborating directly with a top executive I helped formalize a new company logo and created an original website design that integrated the new aesthetic and presented the breadth and depth of the firm's achievements.

✰ Outcome
Modernizing the company's website, introducing a new logo, and launching these new assets via an upgraded domain name positioned the company to present major new opportunities to investors with a fresh, grounded optimism that reflects their business gravitas and rich portfolio of projects.
